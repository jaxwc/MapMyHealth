This project presents a novel method for recommending a patient with next steps to getting healthy based on their current symptoms and predicted conditions based on those symptoms.

We rely on a simulated/fake dataset of condition likelihood based on patient data, symptoms, and test results (findings). In the future, this dataset would be build based on real diagnoses and patient data/findings which we do not have access to at this time.

We also map actions that a patient can take (tests, monitoring, treatment) that produce outcome findings. These actions are simulated based on the patient's current state to determine the quickest path to condition certainty (which tests or actions reveal the patient's health outcome the quickest)?

This action map is displayed for the user to visualize their care/treatment options based on their current situation and possible futures.
